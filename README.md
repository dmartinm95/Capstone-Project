# Capstone-Project
Source code for for Flutter Application called "Kardio Care"

Features:
- Receive and display real time ECG signal from an Arduino Nano BLE 33
- Create ECG recordings of different lengths: 1, 5 and 10 minutes
- Store recordings and data statistics using HIVE database
- Implemented simplified version of Pan Tompkins Algorithm for estimating the heart rate in real time
- Used Tensorflow Lite to load a neural network model for predicting arrhythmias
